# PF_Sintering
The goal of this project is to investigate numerically the sintering phenomenon. For instance, L. Carbillet has shown that the microstructure composed of glass beads evolves with the sintering [1].

The Phase-Field formulation from [2] is applied through the solver [Moose](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/).
